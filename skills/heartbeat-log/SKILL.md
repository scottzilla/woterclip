# Heartbeat Log

Parse and summarize the WoterClip heartbeat log file (`.woterclip/heartbeat-log.jsonl`).

## Log Format

Each line is a JSON object — one record per heartbeat cycle (not per issue):
```json
{"heartbeat": 7, "timestamp": "2026-03-25T10:15:00Z", "issues_dispatched": 2, "results": [{"issue": "WOT-79", "persona": "backend", "status": "in_progress", "commits": 1, "sub_issues": 0}, {"issue": "WOT-81", "persona": "frontend", "status": "done", "commits": 2, "sub_issues": 0}], "duration_sec": 720}
```

Fields:
- `heartbeat` — Cycle counter (increments each heartbeat run)
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601 start time
- `issues_dispatched` — Number of issues worked this cycle
- `results[]` — Per-issue outcomes: issue ID, persona, final status, commit count, sub-issues created
- `duration_sec` — Wall-clock time for the entire cycle

## Procedure

### Step 1: Read Log

Read `.woterclip/heartbeat-log.jsonl`. If missing or empty, report "No heartbeat history found."

Parse each line as JSON. Handle malformed lines gracefully (skip with warning).

### Step 2: Summarize

**Recent activity** (default: last 10 heartbeats):

```
Heartbeat History
─────────────────
#7  10:15  backend   WOT-79  In Progress  (12 min)
#6  09:45  backend   WOT-81  Completed    (8 min)
#5  09:15  ceo       WOT-80  Triaged      (4 min)
```

**Aggregate stats** (when asked for analytics or summary):

- Total heartbeats
- Heartbeats per persona (breakdown)
- Average duration per persona
- Completion rate (completed / total)
- Most active issues (by heartbeat count)
- Blocked issues and duration blocked

### Step 3: Filter Options

Support filtering when the user asks:
- **By persona**: "show backend heartbeats" → filter by `results[].persona` field
- **By issue**: "show activity for WOT-79" → filter by `results[].issue` field
- **By date range**: "show today's heartbeats" → filter by `timestamp`
- **By status**: "show blocked heartbeats" → filter by `status`

## Notes

- The log file is append-only and informational — safe to truncate if it grows too large
- Heartbeat numbers are per-cycle counters (one number per heartbeat run), not per-issue
- Duration is wall-clock time from heartbeat start to report posting
